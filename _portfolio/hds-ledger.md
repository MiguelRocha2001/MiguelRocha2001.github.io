HDS Serenity Ledger is a simplified permissioned (closed membership) blockchain system with high dependability guarantees. It uses the Istanbul BFT consensus algorithm to ensure that all nodes run commands in the same order, achieving State Machine Replication (SMR) and guarantees that all nodes have the same state. Overall, the system allows the clients to perform crypto exchanges, as well as consulting their current account balance.

This was a project I have conducted as part of my Distributed Systems course at the University of Tecnico, Lisbon. The project was developed in Java and uses web sockets to implement the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm. The project was developed in a team of 3 students (shown in GitHub as contributers).
