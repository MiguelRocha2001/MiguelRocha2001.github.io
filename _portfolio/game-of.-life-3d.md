The Game of Life is a zero-player game that starts from an initial distribution of individuals in the game space. The game evolves by computing new generations of individuals based on simple rules.

This project implements the 3D Game of Life in C as part of the IST MEIC CPD course. The game is implemented in three versions:
- Serial/Sequential;
- Parallel with OpenMP;
- Parallel with MPI.
