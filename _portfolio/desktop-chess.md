As part of my studies in ISEL, TDS course, me, and two of my collegues developed a Chess game in Kotlin, for the Desktop platform. The game is a classic chess game, where you have to checkmate the enemy king, before he checkmates yours. The game has a simple interface, and it is very easy to play. The game was developed using Kotlin and Compose, and it is a Desktop application.
