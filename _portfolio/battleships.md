As part of my studies in ISEL, me, and two of my collegues developed a Battleships game in Kotlin, for the Android platform, and for the Browser. The game is a classic battleships game, where you have to sink the enemy ships, before they sink yours. The game has a simple interface, and it is very easy to play. Both the Android application and the Browser version are the clients. Then, there's the Backend server, built with Koltin and Spring Boot, that manages the game, and the players. The server is responsible for the game logic, and for the communication between the clients.
