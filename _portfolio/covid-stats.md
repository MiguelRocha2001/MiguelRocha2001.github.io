This was a personal project that I had the idea to develop when the covid consumed the whole world.
Whith this Android application, you can check various Covid-19 statistics around the world, including statistics for each individual coundtry, or continent.
I tried to published the app on the Google play, but, unfortunately, it was rejected, since only governamental entities could publish such apps.
