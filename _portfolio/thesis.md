Bitcoin is the most popular blockchain but it remains largely siloed. Approaches such as the Interblockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) allow different blockchain system to communicate with each other in a centralized way. However, the requirements imposed by IBC are currently not satisfied by Bitcoin which prevents to communicate with other blockchains in a trustless manner.

The goal of this thesis is to research and develop mechanisms that allow to connect Bitcoin to IBC in a manner as trustless as possible.

**Notice:** This thesis is under development, and, therefore, I cannot publish more details about my work. Started in June, 2024, with plans to be finished in July, 2025.
