This is a personal project that I am still developing. The idea is to create an Android application that allows the user to search for movies and series, get information about them, such as the cast, the plot, the rating, etc, and wach the it directly on the app.

The app uses the YTS API to retreive the movies and series information, including magnet torrent links, and [TorrentStream-Android](https://github.com/se-bastiaan/TorrentStream-Android), a torrent streamer library for Android based on libtorrent4j.
