## Overview

I developed this application, during the summer of 2022, as a way to learn more about Android development. The app is a simple Covid-19 statistics app, that uses the [Covid-19 API](https://disease.sh/docs/), to get the data. The app is very simple, it has a main screen, where the user can see the global statistics, and a search screen, where the user can search for a specific country and see its statistics. Most countries are supported.

The code is written in Kotlin, and the app uses the MVVM architecture, with the repository pattern. The app also uses the http4k library, to make the API requests.

**Notice:** This project was not part of any course, it was a personal project, to learn more about Android development.
